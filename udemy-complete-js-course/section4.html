  <h1>Javascript is fun, but so is HTML & CSS!</h1>
  <p> You can learn Javascript without HTML & CSS, but for DOM manipulations, its useful to have some basic ideas of HTML & CSS</p>
  <p>Just another paragraph</p>

  <h2>Another heading</h2>
  <h3>Another Heading</h3>
  <h4>Another Heading</h4>
  <h5>Another Heading</h5>
  <h6>Another Heading</h6>

  ! + tab will auto create the broiler plate html.

  <a> is an anchor element...most commonly used with href to link to other stuff</a>

  href = hypertext reference - it could link to a website, page, profile, image, etc.

  <a href=""></a>

  we also have the image element which is usually sourced to an image

  <img src=""/>

  the img element does not have a closing tag. 

  we give elements both classes and ids. Classes in HTML for CSS, and IDs in HTML for Javascript
  
  they can be added to any element. 

  Ids can only be used once per page, where as Classes can be used multiple times. 

  HTML has built in elements for forms 

  The input element also has no closing tag


  <form id="your-name">
    <h2>Your Name here</h2>
    <p>Please fill in this form</p>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Your Name"/>
    <button>OK!</button>
  </form>

  now with CSS, an important thing to consider is inheritance. Like a font would like inherit everything from its parent element, but other child/parents not so much.
