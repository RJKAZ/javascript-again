// JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

// Values and Variables - the assignment called for using only the let method, but I used let along with var and const to demonstrate all three. 

let country = "USA";
var continent = "North America";
const population = 328000000;

console.log(country);
console.log(continent);
console.log(population);
