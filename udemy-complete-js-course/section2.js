// Java script has a special mode called strict mode to use it, it has to be the first line of code in the script file. (not counting comments)

'use strict';

// strict code makes Javascript more secure. It forbids certain things and produces visible errors in the console. 

let hasDriversLicense = false;
const passTest = true;

if (passTest) hasDriversLicense = true;
if (hasDriversLicense) console.log('I can drive :D');

// With strict mode not engaged, this above code will not write to the console because there is a 's' missing from hasDriverLicense
// Its a common spelling mistake error, but this one won't produce any error message on its own. and if you add the 's', the code will then work and write to the console.

// with strict mode engaged, it will give us an error of 'hasDriverLicense' is not defined. 

// script mode can also help tell us when we can't use words that are restricted for Javascript since they might get used at a latter date. 

//const interface = 'Audio';
// const private = 534;
// const if = 23

// from this point on with this course, always have strict mode enabled. 

// Now onto Functions

function logger() {
    console.log('My name is Jonas');
}

// calling / running / invoking function 
logger();
// you can call or use the function as many times as you want. 

// the empty brackets after the function name are used for adding parameters. 

function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
    const juice = `Juice with ${apples} apples and ${oranges} oranges.`;
    return juice;
}

fruitProcessor(5, 0);

const appleJuice = fruitProcessor(5, 0);
console.log(appleJuice);
console.log(fruitProcessor(5, 0));

const appleOrangeJuice = fruitProcessor(2, 4);
console.log(appleOrangeJuice);

// the code in a function is useless if you never call it. 

//Not all functions need to return something or accept parameters 

// console.log is a function as wekk, but that one is built in
