# javascript-again

As the title of the Repo so states, Javascript-Again!

The purpose of this Repo is to be a scratch pad and note collection as I relearn Javascript. Reiterating everything I learn in my own words.

Since November 2019 when I started my coding bootcamp, having no previous coding experience, I was able to learn alot about Javascript in a very short time frame. I feel I definitly have a good foundation in Javascipt but my proficency with it needs alot of work. 

So I'm relearning it from the ground up so I can master it.
